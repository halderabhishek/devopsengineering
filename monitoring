For the Above architectures, would use AWS Cloud Watch, Cloud Trail

We can integrate Cloud Trail in data pipeline that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in AWS Data Pipeline. CloudTrail captures all API calls for AWS Data Pipeline as events.
Cloudwatch can also be used to show the metrics from the instances where the activities is running. Though is not very convenient, but we can find a specific instance where the pipeline was running, and if we have a pipeline failure or performance issue correlate that metrics to the problem.

Amazon CloudWatch Events will monitors the AWS resources and the applications we run on AWS. Amazon CloudWatch Events can detect and react to changes in the state of a pipeline, stage, or action. Then, based on rules that we are setting up, CloudWatch Events invokes one or more target actions when a pipeline, stage, or action enters the state we specify in a rule. Depending on the type of state change, we might want to send notifications if needed, capture state information.
